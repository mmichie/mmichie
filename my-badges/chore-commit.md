Remove DEBUG_GLOBALS, DEBUG_COMP, and types module debug output
that was added during investigation. The root issues have been
fixed and the debug code is no longer needed.

Files cleaned:
- builtin/misc.go: removed DEBUG_GLOBALS output and unused os import
- eval/evaluator.go: removed DEBUG_COMP output and unused os import
- modules/python_loader.go: removed types module debug output
