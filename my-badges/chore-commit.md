- Removed commented debug print statements from parser/parser.go
- Replaced panic() with log.Fatal() in initialization functions:
  - core/list_methods.go: InitListMethods()
  - core/dict_methods.go: InitDictMethods()
  - core/set_methods.go: InitSetMethods()
- Removed unused getNumber() function from builtin/utilities.go
- Left intentional panic() calls in Must* pattern functions (following Go conventions)
- Left controlled panic() in eval/evaluator.go (only triggers when StrictDuplicateChecking is enabled)
